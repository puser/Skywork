(312, 335, NULL, 15, 'When considering the likelihood of a \\"double-dip\\" recession in the US, international volatility seems to be a stronger (and less predictable) factor than domestic concerns. There are three main points for consideration: the Eurozone crisis (specifically the outlook for Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy), the situation in Iran and US agricultural prices (specifically vis-a-vis this summer\\''s heavy drought). The combined effect of these will have an enormous influence on the economic climate through the end of the year and into 2013.\n\nWhile the crisis in the Eurozone appears to have stabilized somewhat at the moment as the markets anticipate a likely extension to Greece\\''s austerity targets, Spanish debt yields remain at alarmingly high levels and German growth has begun to slow. There is still a widely held belief that the danger will not truly pass until Merkel and the German Bundesbank allow collective debt (Eurobonds) to be issued by the ECB, which, with Merkel\\''s CSU under heavy domestic pressure, seems as unlikely as ever.\n\nMeanwhile NATO, or at least the US, seems likely to be pushed into a military conflict with Iran by an increasingly bellicose Israeli government -- despite unease from within the Israeli defense community -- before the end of this year. While Western petroleum demand has shifted firmly away from Iran since the beginning of the year with the implementation of increasingly heavy industrial and financial sanctions, a conflict in the Gulf will still have a dramatic effect on oil prices; if prices break through $200 per barrel for any length of time, a US recession in 2013 seems inevitable, even if the administration taps the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of these threats, US food prices are expect to rise dramatically over the next several months due to heavy droughts across the county. \n\nIn conclusion, blah blah blah we\\''re probably all fucked. I\\''m putting the odds of a 2013 recession at 50/50.'),

In many countries, the principal business is tourism, and there are many government job opportunities for graduates as well.Since the hospitality industry is so large, and its major companies are so often headquartered in the United States, it would seem logical that you would want to study hospitality in the United States. A visit to any major city around the world will show you how common the presence of a U. S. company is. Names like Hilton, Starwood, Hyatt, or Marriott should be familiar to you. All of these companies, and hundreds of other ones, visit the major hospitality schools every year to recruit students who want to begin their management careers with a major hospitality company. Instructors in U. S. hospitality programs have experience cooking most international cuisines in addition to teaching you how an international hotel operates. No other country offers a student the opportunities for a well-founded career in hospitality like the United States and no other country has the range of college programs where you can learn about those career opportunities.  Finally, there is the opportunity to manage food service in schools, hospitals, and in all the numerous other places where people congregate.  These jobs offer some great job benefits, as well as an opportunity to work with people who truly appreciate the food they are receiving. Hospitality is one thing but Culinary arts is another passion of mine and  i think that if i study Culinary arts and Hospitality that i would end up with a better job. To me  Culinary Art is known as the art of food preparation. This includes an array of area such as cooking, food presentation, food photography, hotel and restaurant management, and much more. If we will summarize this in a simple sentence, we can say that Culinary Arts is an expression of oneâ€™s artistic ideas through food or food-related means.. The people involved in Culinary Arts are called Culinary Arts Professionals. They can be the different types of chefs who prepare your food, or the restaurant manager who takes care a restaurantâ€™s daily operations. Anyone who completes a Culinary Arts Degree and works in the field of Culinary Arts can be regarded as a Professional in the Culinary Arts. In ten years I see my self in a position where i am able to satisfy all the needs for hospitality and culinary arts. I see my self working on cruise ships or managing hotels and restaurants, and finally even CEO of  a 5 star hotel corporation.'),
