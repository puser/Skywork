			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Thank you for choosing Puentes. Puentes takes the privacy of its users very seriously. Please take the time to read through our Privacy Policy. Below is a summary of a few key points, which are how Puentes acts: </p>
			<ul >
				<li>- We never ask for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
				<li>- We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, to continue the development our products, or protect our rights.</li>
				<li>- We don't store personal information unless required for the on-going operation our services.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact: Sean Daly, CEO (sean@puentesonline.com). It is Puentes' policy, and in its best interest, to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while conducting our everyday activities and business processes.</p>
			
			<p>Website Use<br />
			Like most website operators, Puentes collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each user request. Puentes' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how users use the website. Puentes collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.</p>
			
			<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<br />
			Certain users of Puentes' websites choose to interact with Puentes in ways that require Puentes to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Puentes gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, in order to sign-up for Puentes, users must provide at least an email address and password. Those who buy our subscription services are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. Puentes collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user's interaction.</p>
			
			<p>Aggregated Statistics<br />
			Puentes collects aggregate statistics about the behavior of users to its websites. For example, Puentes may monitor usage data to help make our products better. Puentes may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Puentes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
			
			<p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<br />
			Puentes may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on Puentes' behalf, such as using personal data to process a credit card. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Puentes' websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Puentes will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone other than its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, Puentes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Puentes believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Puentes, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Puentes website and have supplied your email address, Puentes may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or to answer Help issues. You may choose to opt out of these emails. If you send us a request (for example, via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Puentes takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
			
			<p>Cookies<br />
			A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user returns. Puentes may use cookies to help track users, their usage of the website, and their website access preferences. Puentes users who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before entering the website.</p>
			
			<p>Business Transfers<br />
			If Puentes, or substantially all its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Puentes were to go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information will be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Puentes may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
			
			<p>Privacy Policy Changes<br />
			Puentes has the right to change its Privacy Policy at anytime for any reason. Puentes encourages users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitue your acceptance of such change.</p>
