			<p class="site-page-header">Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</p>
			<p>Most customer concerns will be resolved as quickly as possible through one of our help blogs or by emailing directly to sean@puentesonline.com. In the unlikely event that our customer service resources are unable to resolve a complaint or conern you may have (or if PuC has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through the process detailed below.</p>

			<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to PuC should be addressed to Sean Daly, Puentes Company, 55 Merrick Way, Suite 202, Coral Gables, Florida 33134 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If PuC and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or PuC may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>a) Any ìunresolvedî dispute, controversy or claim arising from, connected to or related in any manner with this Agreement including, but not limited to, its breach, termination, expiration, or invalidation, or with the relation of the parties under the terms hereof (the ìDisputeî), shall be resolved and decided by binding arbitration, pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ìICCî). The arbitrator shall have the exclusive right to determine the arbitrability of any Disputes. In the event of any conflict between the rules of the ICC and any provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.</li>
				<li>b) The juridical seat of the arbitration shall be the City of Miami, Florida, United States of America, and the proceedings will be conducted there or at such other location upon which the Parties to the arbitration may agree.</li>
				<li>c) The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, provided however, that any Party may submit testimony or documentary evidence in a language other than English and shall, upon the request of the sole arbitrator or any other Party to the arbitration proceeding, furnish a translation or interpretation into English of any such testimony or documentary evidence.</li>
				<li>d) There shall be a sole arbitrator for all Disputes. The Parties may, by agreement, nominate the sole arbitrator for confirmation by the ICC. If they fail to do so within 30 days from the date that the Respondent receives Claimantís Request for Arbitration, or such additional time as allowed by the ICC Secretariat, then the sole arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC.</li>
				<li>e) The sole arbitrator shall award the prevailing Party its attorneysí fees and costs, arbitration administrative fees, panel member fees and costs, and any other costs associated with the arbitration. The sole arbitrator may only award damages as provided for under the terms of the Agreement and in no event may punitive, consequential and special damages be awarded.</li>
				<li>f) The sole arbitrator shall be required to apply the substantive law of the Customerís home country in ruling upon any Dispute.</li>
				<li>g) The Parties hereby agree that the dispute resolution procedures specified in this Article shall be the sole, exclusive procedures for the resolution of Disputes between or among the Parties arising from or relating to the Agreement, including all documents made a part thereof, provided, however, that any Party may seek a preliminary injunction or other preliminary judicial relief if, in its reasonable, good-faith judgment, such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage.  Despite such action, the Parties shall continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this Article.</li>
				<li>h) Any decision or award of the sole arbitrator shall be reasoned and in writing, and shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the arbitration proceeding.  The Parties hereby agree not to invoke or exercise any and all rights to appeal, review, vacate or impugn such decision or award by the sole arbitrator. The Parties also agree that the arbitral decision or award may be enforced against the Parties to the arbitration proceeding or their assets wherever they may be found, and that a judgment upon the arbitral decision or award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>
				<li>i) The Parties hereby agree that if any Party to the arbitration proceeding fails or refuses to voluntarily comply with any arbitral decision or award within 30 days after the date on which it receives notice of the decision or award, the other Party, the sole arbitrator or their attorneys-in-fact may immediately proceed to request judicial approval necessary for the execution of such decision or award, before a competent judge of the domicile of such refusing Party or before any other court of competent jurisdiction.  Further, if any prevailing Party is required to retain counsel to enforce the arbitral decision or award, the Party against whom the decision or award is made shall reimburse the prevailing Party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred and paid to said counsel for such service.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>References to "PuC", "you", "us", ìpartyî or ìpartiesî include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and PuC are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This agreement evidences a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
			
			<p class="site-page-header">Fees and Renewals</p>
			<p>From time to time, we may offer different subscription terms, and the membership fees for such subscriptions may vary. The membership fees are non-refundable except as expressly set forth below. Unless you notify us before the renewal date of your membership that you want to cancel or auto renew, your subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us (without notice to you) to collect the then applicable subscription fees, using any valid payment source we have on record for you.</p>
			
			<p class="site-page-header">Free Trials and Refund Policy</p>
			<p>Free trials of certain PuC products and services may be offered from time to time. The terms and conditions of such free trials shall be contained in the offer. No refund of any amount paid shall be granted under any of the following circumstances: 1) the accurate conversion of a free trial to a paid service; 2) the accurate collection of any fee for any active subscription service; or 3) the accurate collection of fees or other payment for any other product or service.</p>
			
			<p class="site-page-header">Miscellaneous</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a) Location & Interpretation. The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.</li>
				<li>b) Equitable Relief. You acknowledge that any breach by you of the provisions of the Agreement will cause irreparable damage to PuC or Others and that a remedy at law will be inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any and all other legal or equitable remedies, PuC and Others will be entitled to injunctive relief for any breach of this Agreement.</li>
				<li>c) Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</li>
				<li>d) Complete Integration. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and PuC pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and serves as an absolute integration thereof. You agree to review this Agreement prior to any Site Use, and each Site Use by you shall constitute and be deemed your unconditional acceptance of this Agreement. This Agreement may be prospectively modified by PuC, by posting a revised Agreement on the Site.</li>
				<li>e) Termination. The Agreement may be terminated by either Party, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and for any reason (with or without cause), with or without notice. If the Agreement is terminated, you agree to cease all Site Use and, upon request by PuC, to return all Information in your possession relating to the Site, and all copies thereof.</li>
				<li>f) Survival of Certain Provisions. Any and all provisions or obligations contained in this Agreement which by their nature or effect are required or intended to be observed, kept or performed after termination of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement and remain binding upon and for the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assignees.</li>
				<li>g) Waiver. No delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy accruing to PuC upon any breach or default by you shall constitute a waiver by PuC of any breach or default.</li>
				<li>h) Headings. All article or section headings, or exhibit names, are for reference and convenience only and shall not be considered in the interpretation of the Agreement.</li>
